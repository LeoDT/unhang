Two method to guess next letter:
1. from to this [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequencies) get a letter list, if there is no letter right, pop a letter from the list.
2. if there is at least one letter was right, go to the dict search this word, and count all the letters from matched words, the next letter is the max count one.

So the accuracy could be affected by the dict, bigger dict get better result.
This dict(words), is from /usr/share/dict/words.
